Recognizing and predicting the human activity using the smartphone data using smartphone tools like , accelerometer , gyroscope  etc.

Using machine learning algorithms to categories various physical activities based on information gathered from a smartphone's sensors is known as "human activity recognition using smartphone data." Twenty-eight individuals between the ages of 19 and 48 participated in the experiments. Wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) around their waist, each participant engaged in six different activities: walking, walking up stairs, walking down stairs, sitting, standing, and lying. We recorded 3-axial angular velocity and 3-axial linear acceleration at a steady rate of 50Hz using its integrated accelerometer and gyroscope. The trials were captured on camera so that the data could be manually labelled. After being randomly divided into two sets, the generated dataset was used to generate training data for 70% of the volunteers and test data for 30% of them.

Noise filters were used to pre-process the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor signals before sampling them in fixed-width sliding windows with a 50% overlap and a duration of 2.56 seconds (128 readings/window). A Butterworth low-pass filter was used to separate the gravitational and body motion components of the sensor acceleration data into body acceleration and gravity. Since it is believed that the gravitational force solely consists of low frequency components, a filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.3 Hz was employed. A vector of features was derived from each window by computing variables in the frequency and time domains.

The project's objective is to train a machine learning model with this data so that it can correctly categories the tasks that study participants complete. In order to accomplish this, we must pre-process the data in order to extract essential attributes for differentiating between the various actions. Then, we can train a machine learning model—a decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, or neural network—using these features. Lastly, in order to assess how well our model generalizes to new examples of activities, we can assess its performance using an independent test dataset.
